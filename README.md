# fonsole

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup Instructions
* Download Repo Manually or Clone it (Recommended)

* Make sure to have [NPM (node package manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm) installed on your system and its version greater than or equal to 3.0.0.  To update, run (with admin privileges):

* Open cmd.exe with admin privileges, browse to repo folder, and run the following command

	```npm install npm@latest -g```

* Install dependencies:

  ```npm install```

* Serve with "hot reload" at localhost:8080. Hot reload means that server will automatically update when changes are made to the code.

  ```npm run dev```

* Build for production with minification

  ```npm run build```

* Build for production and view the bundle analyzer report

  ```npm run build --report```
